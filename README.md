# Ecommerce-Web-Application

The E-Commerce Web Application project is a robust, full-stack application designed to provide a complete e-commerce solution. The front-end is developed using React, a powerful and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It leverages Tailwind CSS and Material-UI (MUI) for modern, responsive, and customizable UI components, ensuring a sleek and user-friendly design. State management is handled by Redux, allowing for efficient and predictable state changes across the application. For authentication, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used, providing a secure and scalable way to manage user sessions.

On the back-end, the project utilizes Spring Boot, a powerful Java-based framework that simplifies the development of production-ready applications. Spring Security is integrated to ensure robust protection against various security threats, while MySQL is used as the database for reliable and efficient data storage.

The project repository is well-organized, containing all the necessary source code, configuration files, and detailed documentation to guide you through the development process. Additionally, a comprehensive Postman API collection is included, allowing you to test and interact with the RESTful API endpoints effortlessly.
